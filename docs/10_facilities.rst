Facilities
=============
This chapter assumes that the reader is familiar with the general
principles explained in the :doc:`06_api` chapter.

The MFL is not merely a "list" of facilities; it has rich APIs to manage their
life cycles and to support interaction with other healthcare systems. This
chapter concerns itself with what is arguably the "core" of the MFL system
- the maintenance of facility information.
