The API Sandbox
============================
Our experience teaches us that the biggest roadblock to systems integration
is usually communication. Developers operate at a level of precision and
detail that is alien to most people. We've been spoilt by our past dabblings
with high quality API documentation sites like the `Stripe API site`_.

.. _`Stripe API site`: https://stripe.com/docs/api

TBD - swagger
TBD - browseable API
TBD - metadata
TBD - An example for each of the verbs in use
TBD - Metadata ( should be more consumable, almost like Stripe's )
TBD - Swagger compatible docstrings for every single view
( first line summary, detailed description, params from filters including base filter)
