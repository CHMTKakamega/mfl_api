MFL APIs: Community Health Units
==================================
This chapter assumes that the reader is familiar with the general
principles explained in the :doc:`api` chapter.

This chapter concerns itself with the resources that model community health
units and link them to facilities.

.. note::

    Community health units are an extension of the Master Facilities List. A
    community health unit is a health service delivery structure within a
    defined geographic area covering a population of approximately 5,000
    people.

    Each unit is assigned 2 Community Health Extension Workers ( CHEWs ) and community health volunteers who offer promotie, preventative and basic
    curative services.

    Each unit is governed by a Community Health Committee ( CHC ) and is
    **linked to a specific health facility**.

    The role of a community health unit is to bring services closer to the
    people that need them. Those services include:

        * Water and sanitation hygiene; e.g. Faecal management, Household water treatment and demonstrations on hand washing with soap, etc.
        * Advice on maternal and child health e.g. Immunization, Individual birth plan, etc.
        * Provision of Family planning commodities.
        * Growth monitoring for children under 5 years.
        * Deworming of children.
        * Provision of Long Lasting Insecticide Treated Nets (LLITNs).
        * Management of diarrhea, injuries, wounds, jiggers and other minor illnesses.
        * Provision of Information, Education & Communication (IEC) materials
        * Defaulter tracing (ART, TB and Immunization)
        * Referrals to health facilities
        * First Aid Services

The implementation of community health units in this API is semi-independent.
The units connect to the rest of MFL at only one point - their linkage to
facilities.
