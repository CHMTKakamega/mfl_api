Installing for evaluation
============================
TBD - **everything here is work in progress**


Deployment Assumptions
-----------------------
The deployment scripts will fail unless the following are true:

  * you are on a recent Ubuntu ( Ubuntu 14.04LTS or newer should work, other Debian derivatives *may* work )
  * you have run ``ssh-keygen`` and have a public key at ``$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub``

Vagrant
----------
You will need to have the vagrant-env plugin - https://github.com/gosuri/vagrant-env .
